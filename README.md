# Fouriertransformation

This is only the code and not our complete submission

### Project

The goal of this task was to develop a foundational understanding of Fourier transformation for approximating periodic functions and applying it practically for data analysis and manipulation. The task required creating a structured Jupyter Notebook to address the following:

  Implementation of Fourier Transform in NumPy: Manually calculating Fourier components using the trapezoidal rule, approximating functions, and evaluating accuracy with controlled errors.
  Analysis of Solar Data: Using Fourier analysis to study sunspot data, identify dominant periodicities, and compare results with manually computed coefficients.
  Music Signal Processing: Analyzing sound waveforms and spectra, filtering frequencies, reconstructing signals, and evaluating the impact on the original signal.
  Image Processing: Performing Fourier analysis on images, filtering specific components, reconstructing images, and exploring the compression limits without exceeding acceptable error thresholds.
